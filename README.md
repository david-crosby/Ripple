# Ripple - Fundraiser Platform

THIS IS A LEARNING PROJECT - THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION CODE

## Project Description

Ripple is a full-stack web application designed to connect people with causes that matter. Built as a comprehensive learning project, Ripple enables users to create fundraising campaigns, share their stories, and collect donations from supporters around the world. The platform aims to demonstrate enterprise-level software architecture whilst providing a practical vehicle for mastering modern web development technologies.

At its core, Ripple facilitates the complete fundraising lifecycle: users can register and authenticate securely, create campaign pages with rich media content, set funding goals, and process donations through integrated payment systems. Each campaign serves as a focal point for community engagement, allowing fundraisers to share updates and donors to track progress towards goals.

The project is architected as a modern microservices-inspired application with clear separation of concerns. The backend leverages FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, connected to a MySQL database for robust data persistence. The frontend will be built with React, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface. Infrastructure is containerised using Docker, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments. Stripe handles secure payment processing, whilst AWS S3 manages media storage for campaign images and assets.

## Project Aims

The primary aim of Ripple is educational: to gain production-ready experience with Python and React through building a real-world application from the ground up. This involves mastering not just the languages themselves, but the entire ecosystem surrounding modern web development—API design, database modelling, authentication patterns, payment integration, cloud services, and DevOps practices.

Beyond technical skills, this project aims to demonstrate proficiency in software engineering best practices: writing clean, well-documented code with comprehensive comments; following conventional commit standards; implementing proper security measures including JWT authentication and password hashing; and creating maintainable, scalable architecture.

Finally, Ripple serves as a portfolio piece showcasing the ability to take a concept from initial planning through to a functional, deployable application. The completed project will demonstrate full-stack capabilities, problem-solving skills, and the capacity to integrate multiple complex systems into a cohesive whole.
